                    <h4>I'm currently learning Python Advanced and OOP in SoftUni Bulgaria</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p> The main goal when I was starting with the programming was to learn just Basic course and then to continue
                    with Data Analysis. This was happened in the beginning of January (2023), but only two months later I
                    was fully inloved in Python. In the end of July I was finished with Fundamentals and already added more than 15 projects in my CV. </p>
                    <p>Nowadays, I am continue learning not only the concepts in the course but I am
                    looking for more and more challenges.</p>
                    <p> This website is part of my new challenge to make my first project with Django. Part of the html and css
                    codes here are just copied because they are in my future plans for learn.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>I am still looking for my first internship</p>
                    <p>For now I was working only on one personal work project, for comparing account balances by using Excel sheets.
                    One of the other project that I have already taken a part was for a game. Unfortunately I wasn't so involved in pygame
                    and I was only helped with the menu of it. The main logic was created by a colleague from SoftUni, but he is 2 courses above
                    my knowledge.</p>

					<p>Python, Django, Tkinter, turtle and pygame. Some note on the last two of the list - I am not so good in them.</p>

                    <h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>By courses in SoftUni and by self-preparation. Using literature from stackoverflow, a lot of books and videos.
                    Every day, I communicate with my teachers, colleagues and friends in the Programming area, which help me to develop my abilities.</p>

				    <hr>
				    <p>First I should finish the course stage in SoftUni, then I was hoping that I would be prepared with the web
                    knowledge also, which will give me a chance to find my first internship in Programming area.</p>
